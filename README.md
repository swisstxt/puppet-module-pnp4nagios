Overview
--------

Puppet module for managing pnp4nagios.

Module Description
------------------

Manages pnp4nagios install and configuration.

Setup
-----

**what pnp4nagios affects:**

* the npcd service
* config files for pnp4nagios

### Beginning with pnp4nagios

This will install pnp4nagios and set it up.

    include pnp4nagios

Usage
-----

Defaults for vars to set if you need them. Basically comes down to setting `$monotoring_type` and if you use my monitoring module thats already setup.
These are class params so use hiera or and ENC to set them up easily.

    $ensure = true
    $monitoring_type = hiera('monitoring::params::monitoring_type')
    $log_type = file
    $debug_lvl = 0

Implementation
--------------

Uses files based on templates to manage the pnp4nagios config files.
I have included some tricky logic to make sure the pnp4nagios service on Fedora 18 starts and stops properly.

Limitations
------------

There may be some. Don't hesitate to let me know if you find any.

Development
-----------

All development, testing and releasing is done by me at this stage.
If you wish to join in let me know.
